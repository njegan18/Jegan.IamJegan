        <h3>What is wisdom</h3>
        <span>
          how can I gain wisdom. ? Is worship my god. I read and follow my holy
          religious books. Can I assume that would gain wisdom ? Every
          Individual is different, everyone has their own journey and path way.
          Getting knowledge from one specific religion or sector will not be
          sufficient. Worshipping Christ, Krishna or Allah and reading those
          holy books and following alone will not gain wisdom. One should have
          principles of his own after understanding the good, bad, nature of
          life and whatever comes in his way, should be determined in following
          it. The determination comes from mind, and if one is capable of
          controlling the mind and not controlled by mind, should be able to
          follow the paths of renowned saints or even creates his own foot path.
